If you donâ€™t have access to a Sense HAT, you can use the emulator.

### Sense HAT emulator on Raspberry Pi

If you are using a Raspberry Pi, there is a Sense HAT emulator included with Raspbian.

+ From the main menu, select **Programming** > **Sense HAT emulator** to open a window containing the emulator.

+ If you are using this version of the emulator, you must import from `sense_emu` instead of `sense_hat`:

```python
from sense_emu import SenseHat
```

If you later want to run your code on a real Sense HAT, just change the import line back. All other code remains exactly the same. 

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat
```
